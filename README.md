# Project Setup Guide

This is a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the project locally using Expo. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.

---

### 1. 📥 Clone the Repository

Clone the boilerplate to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moinBukhari147/react-native-boiler-plate.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. 📦 Install Dependencies

Install all required packages using Yarn (recommended):

```bash
yarn install
```

Or use npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. ⚙️ Start the Development Server

Start the Expo development server:

```bash
yarn expo
```

This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser. From there, you can launch the app on:

- Android emulator or Expo Go
- iOS simulator (Mac only) or Expo Go
- Web browser

### 4. 🧼 Clear Expo Cache (Optional)

If you run into unexpected issues, clear the cache:

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

### 5. 📝 Rename the App

Update the app name by editing `app.json`:

```json
{
    "name": "YourAppName",
    "slug": "your-app-name"
}
```

### 6. 📲 Run the App on Emulator or Device

To run on Android:

```bash
yarn android
```

To run on iOS (Mac only):

```bash
yarn ios
```

To run in a browser:

```bash
yarn web
```

### 7. 🆙 Upgrade Dependencies (Optional)

Upgrade to the latest Expo SDK and compatible versions:

```bash
npx expo upgrade
```

Then install recommended dependencies:

```bash
npx expo install
```

### 8. 💅 Configure VS Code (Recommended)

This boilerplate includes a pre-configured `.vscode/extensions.json` file that automatically recommends essential VS Code extensions when you open the project.

When prompted in VS Code, simply **click “Install All”** to set up the recommended development tools.

#### Recommended Extensions:

- ✅ **ESLint** — `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`
- ✅ **Prettier - Code Formatter** — `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
- ✅ **Indent Rainbow** — `oderwat.indent-rainbow`
- ✅ **VSCode Icons** — `vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons`

> ℹ️ If the recommendation prompt doesn't appear, you can install them manually from the Extensions panel by searching the names above.

### 9. 🛠 VS Code Settings (Auto Formatting, ESLint, and Imports)

The project includes pre-defined settings in `.vscode/settings.json` to enforce consistent formatting and code quality.

These settings enable auto-formatting with Prettier, auto-fix ESLint issues, and automatically organize/sort imports and class members on save.

#### Included Settings:

```json
{
    "editor.tabSize": 4,
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "eslint.enable": true,
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
        "source.fixAll": "explicit",
        "source.sortMembers": "explicit"
    }
}
```

### 10. ✅ Verify Everything Works

Run the app:

```bash
yarn expo
```
